                GeoGuessr is a geographic exploration game, where you get dropped in a random google street view spot 
                anywhere around the world, and get points based on how close you guess.  
                It's a game I played a lot a few years ago, and recently I rekindled my interest in the game.
                <ul>
                    <li>There's a popular game-mode of GeoGuessr streamed on Twitch called Blackjack</li>
                    <li>The object of this game-mode is to get a final score in between two shifting intervals 
                        <li>i.e. 5,000 - 15,000 points one round, then 6,000 - 14,000 points the next round</li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This continues until there is a winner
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Like real Blackjack, if you go over the maximum score interval, you are eliminated
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The difficult part of this, is that if a player doesn't get in between those two scores in a round, 
                    then they can't be counted as in the game still.  So I wanted to design an efficient way to track users who
                    are still in the game as the game goes on.
                </p>            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        So I set off, and designed a really simple Discord bot, to message the results of each round
                        <li>Twitch Streamers can add this bot to their discord servers, so everyone in the server can see the status of the game</li>
                        <li>The game operator messages the bot with the GeoGuessr results link, and the two scores</li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here's how I designed the bot:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The content of the results list was downloaded with Python's requests library
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                That content was loaded into a DataFrame, which is part of an easily processable Python Matrix Library called pandas
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next, the data was filtered based on some requirements such as if their score fit into the provided intervals and if they
                                were already in the previous round.  I stored existing players as a dictionary of lists, so multiple users could
                                run concurrent games of Blackjack (the messagers discord id was used as the dictionary key)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This part was really simple, as it was code I had learned while on my first Co-op! Getting the bot to run 
                                all the time was something I hadn't known how to do.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After researching on the internet I decided to use Heroku to run the script I designed.  I setup
                                a heroku worker to call the python run method, for the bot to be online on discord at all times
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Found this idea from reddit, I saw some pictures of an updating scoreboard displaying all 
                mlb scores, pitch count, game situation, etc.  As a huge baseball fan, and novice programmer myself, I tried
                making this.  I bought an Adafruit RGB LED Board to show the scores, and a raspberry pi to load the scores
                from the api.  I didn't write the code for this, I just cloned
