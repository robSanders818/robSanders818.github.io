            GeoGuessr is a geographic exploration game, where you get dropped in a random google street view spot 
            anywhere around the world.  It's a game I played a lot a few years ago, and recently I rekindled my interest in the game.
            <ul>
                <li>There's a popular game-mode that gets streamed called BlackJack</li>
                <li>The object of this game-mode, is to get a final score in between two shifting intervals 
                    <li>i.e. 5,000 - 15,000 points one round, then 6,000 - 14,000 points the next round</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This continues until there is a winner
                </li>
                <li>
                    Like real BlackJack, if you go over the maximum score interval, you are eliminated
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The difficult part of this, is that if a player doesn't get in between those two scores in a round, 
                then they can't be counted as in the game still.  So I wanted to design an efficient way to track users who
                are still in the game as the game goes on.
            </p>            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    So I set off, and designed a really simple Discord bot, to message the results of each round
                    <li>Twitch Streamers can add this bot to their discord servers, so everyone in the server can see the status of the game</li>
                    <li>It functions by the game operator messaging the bot with the GeoGuessr results link, and the two scores</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here's how I designed the bot:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The content of the results list was downloaded with Python's requests library
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            That content was loaded into a DataFrame, which is part of an easily processable Python Matrix Library called pandas
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next data was filtered based on a few requirements, if they fit into the score intervals, if they
                            were already in the previous round.  Stored existing players as a dictionary of lists, so multiple users could
                            run concurrent games of BlackJack (the messagers discord id was used as the dictionary key)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This part was really simple, as it was code I had learned while on my first Co-op! Getting the bot to run 
                            all the time was something I hadn't known how to do
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After researching on the internet I decided to use Heroku to run the script I designed.  I setup
                            a heroku worker to call the run method, for the bot to be online on discord at all times
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </font>
