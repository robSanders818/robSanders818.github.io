            I started my first co-op with the Baltimore Orioles in January of 2020, and have continued to work there throughout the summer.
            It's been amazing working in a baseball team's front office, and one I've aspired to as a passionate baseball fan.
            I've learned so much working with the rest of the front office

        <p>
            We used python django to load/aggregate data from our SQL Database, and React to design the look of the website.
            I acted as a full stack developer taking on back-end projects, while designing the user interactivity side.

        <font size="+1">My interest in Computers started with playing video games on a junky old laptop. The games
            didn't work and I wanted to play without lag. I researched how to build a computer, and decided to go for it. I went to my local
            computer parts store, Micro Center, and purchased all the components to build my computer. I spent an entire night, and a few
            hours in the next morning to insert the ram, apply cpu paste, connect power wires, etc. and finally got it working after
            around 6 hours.</font>
