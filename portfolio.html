        <font size="+1">My interest in Computers started with playing video games on a junky old laptop. The games
            didn't work and I wanted to play without lag. I researched how to build a computer, and decided to go for it. I went to my local
            computer parts store, Micro Center, and purchased all the components to build my computer. I spent an entire night, and a few
            hours in the next morning to insert the ram, apply cpu paste, connect power wires, etc. and finally got it working after
            around 6 hours.</font>
