        <font size="+3">I grew up in Levittown, New York, and always had a passion for 
            programming, and learning Computer Science.  I am currently attending Northeastern University in my second year as a candidate 
            for a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  I'm actively searching for a co-op position for the months of January-June of 2020.
